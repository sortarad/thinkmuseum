## 1st Generation
This was the original design as introduced in 1961. Has a half style cover and “rabbit ear” style retaining clip. The most reliable but not very common.

## 2nd Generation
Plastic lever molded to a chrome pin. Very prone to breakage, stay away from.

## 3rd Generation
Plastic lever molded to plastic cover. The most reliable and the best kind to look for.
